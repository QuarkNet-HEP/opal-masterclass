# OPAL masterclass

## Structure

### Introduction
Fundamental particles and collisions

### The Detector and How to Understand the Event Pictures
Side and end views of the detector and how to identify electrons, muons, and hadrons

### The Challenge (Part 1)
Identify which sort of particle (electron, muon, hadron) is present in 9 events

### How to Identify Events Containing a Particle-Antiparticle Pair
Z boson production and decay into electrons, muons, taus, and quarks with example events of each

### The Challenge (Part 2)
Identify 10 Z decays

### How to Identify Events Containing a Pair of W Particles
Production and decay of W bosons and how to identify the decays (with example events of each):

* both Ws decay to quark and antiquark
* both Ws decay to lepton and neutrino (just one type of lepton shown)
* one W decays to lepton and neutrino and the other to quark and antiquark (examples for e, mu, and tau)

### The Challenge (Part 3)
Identify 10 W decays

### The Challenge (Part 4)
20 total of both Z and WW events mixed together: which are which?

### How to Identify Slightly More Complicated Types of Event
* High Energy Photons in Events Containing a Particle-Antiparticle Pair
* High Energy Gluons in Events Containing a Quark-Antiquark Pair
* "Four Fermion" Events

### The Challenge (Part 5)
Identify 8 events from all types seen up to now

### Measuring Z0 decays
1000 Z events
* identify if they are electron, muon, tau, or quark Events
* determine BR (need know and apply acceptance factors)

**Note:** actually there are more than 1000 events as 622, 961, and 990 appear twice with 2 different events each

### Measuring W decays
479 events of WW and Z (where photons are produced)
* identify if WW or Z event
* if WW then determine (WW to l nu qq):(WW to qqqq) and (WW to l nu l nu):(WW to qqqq)

**Note:** there are 3 events missing (200, 441, and 450)

## TO-DO

- [ ] Right now the site is plain HTML *a la* the original site: add css and use a framework (like Bootstrap)
- [ ] Extract the information on files and answers for challenge 5
- [ ] For the Z and W measurements we need to determine and compile an answer key
- [ ] Extract and use more content from the original site
- [ ] A lot more can be templated
- [ ] Create and use a template for challenge events in which side and end views are shown
- [ ] Deploy at CERN on OpenShift
