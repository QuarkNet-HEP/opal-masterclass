<p>
  If you have enjoyed the challenges so far then you may be interested in
  learning about some more types of event.
  These events are rather like
  <a href="{{url_for('Z') }}"> the events containing a 
    particle-antiparticle pair </a> that we looked at in an earlier section,
  but made slightly more complicated, because extra particles have been added.
</p>
<p>
  One reason why this is interesting is that these extra particles sometimes 
  make it much more difficult to distinguish 
  <a href="{{ url_for('Z') }}"> the events containing a 
    particle-antiparticle pair </a> 
  from <a href="{{ url_for('W') }}"> events containing a pair of 
    W particles</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Take a look at the following new types of events:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="{{ url_for('ffgamma') }}">High Energy Photons in Events Containing a
	Particle-Antiparticle Pair </a>
    <li><a href="{{ url_for('qqg') }}">High Energy Gluons in Events Containing a
	Quark-Antiquark Pair </a>
    <li><a href="{{ url_for('ffff') }}">"Four Fermion" Events</a>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Once you've understood the way we identify the different
  types of new events, then please
  <a href="{{ url_for('challenge5') }}">
    proceed to the next part 
    of the programme,
  </a> which is 
  "Challenge Part 5".
